# Game "idea"
An arsenal of weapons have gone berserk and decided to leave their original wielder "behind", while flying around to defeat various foes they must still protect this person.
This reflects itself in the form of a bound person being led by rope by the weapons (the cursor), while mostly a deadweight it's still their job to protect the person.
## Game Loop
Similar to vampire survivors you protect yourself from waves of monsters while (collecting loot?) / (doing side objectives?)
these waves get stronger and stronger each time, therefore collected money goes to upgrading your weapons / adding weapons to your arsenal or ? upgrades?
the game ends after some decided wave ? boss enemy? idk.
